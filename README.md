# Awesome X - Karma

an app, created during the code camp hackathon heilbronn. 

The intention is, to score all the products of your supermarket and make sustainability more visible. Also we aim to make a challenge out of this score to challenge your friends to live more healthy an environmental friendly. There are also several challenges for yourself. For example to make it 100 days without any meat or 250 days with only local products.
